            <h1>Jib Documentation</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the documentation for Jib, a character whose kind exterior conceals a profoundly disturbing and tragic past.</p>

            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
            <p>Jib is a deceptively simple character in the Pencil Earth Dimension, known for his gentle demeanor and unassuming presence. Beneath his friendly facade lies a story so dark it threatens to shatter the fragile hope of those who learn it was told to.</p>

            <h2 id="story">Jib’s Story</h2>
            <p>In the Pencil Earth Dimension, Jib is a beacon of kindness. He greets everyone with a soft nod of his circular head, offering help to those struggling in this grayscale world. But Jib’s warmth is a mask, forged from a past so horrific it defies comprehension. Before the gamma ray burst that created the Second Earth, Jib lived on the original Earth as a being of pure empathy, absorbing the emotions of others to ease their suffering. His circular form was a symbol of unity, a vessel designed to hold the world’s pain.</p>
            <p>When the gamma ray burst struck, Jib’s empathic nature became his curse. As reality warped into the Pencil Earth Dimension, he absorbed not just the pain of individuals but the collective agony of a dying planet. Billions of voices—filled with terror, grief, and betrayal—flooded his mind, tearing at his essence of his being. In a moment of unbearable torment, Jib’s psyche shattered, and something else emerged: a hollow, parasitic entity that fed on his broken soul. This entity, invisible to all, clings to Jib, forcing him to maintain his kind exterior while whispering unspeakable truths about the universe’s indifference.</p>
            <p>The most disturbing truth is Jib’s secret burden: he remembers every life lost in the gamma ray burst, every scream, every unfulfilled wish. Worse, the entity within him twists these memories into grotesque parodies, forcing Jib to relive them in endless, distorted loops. He smiles at others to hide his torment, but at night, he collapses into silent convulsions, sketching fragmented faces in the dust—faces that scream back at him in his dreams. Jib’s kindness is not a choice but a desperate act to keep the entity at bay, for if he ever stops, it threatens to consume him and unleash its horrors on the Pencil Earth.</p>

            <h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
            <p>Jib’s design is deceptively charming:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Body and Head</strong>: A smooth, circular body and head, perfectly rounded, giving a friendly and approachable vibe.</li>
                <li><strong>Limbs</strong>: Stick-like arms and legs, thin but tough, suggesting resilience despite their simplicity.</li>
                <li><strong>Features</strong>: No hair, no costumes, and no facial details except for faint, expressive eyes that hint at hidden sorrow.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the Pencil Earth Dimension’s grayscale palette, Jib’s clean lines and soft curves make him stand out as a comforting figure, belying the darkness within.</p>

            <h2 id="evolution">Evolution</h2>
            <p>Jib’s form has changed subtly through his trauma:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Original Form (v1.0)</strong>: A vibrant, colorful circular figure on the original Earth, radiating warmth.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Burst (v2.0)</strong>: Transformed into grayscale, with faint cracks in his circular form symbolizing his fractured mind.</li>
                <li><strong>Current Form (v3.0)</strong>: Smoothed over with a polished exterior, but his eyes betray a haunting depth of pain.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h2>
            <p>Jib is defined by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Present Behavior</strong>: Kind, gentle, and always willing to help, projecting an image of hope.</li>
                <li><strong>Hidden Nature</strong>: Tormented by a parasitic entity and memories of a lost world, living in constant fear of losing control.</li>
                <li><strong>Role</strong>: A tragic figure who masks his pain to support others, unaware of how close he is to breaking.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="usage">Usage in Projects</h2>

            <h1>Stickman Documentation</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the documentation for Stickman, a core character in the evolution series, whose tale is marked by tragedy and resilience.</p>
            
            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
            <p>Stickman is the foundational character in the series, representing simplicity and adaptability. A minimalist figure with a rich history, Stickman carries the weight of a world lost to a catastrophic event.</p>
            
            <h2 id="story">Stickman’s Story</h2>
            <p>Stickman hails from the original Earth, a vibrant world of color and life. But everything changed when a blindingly bright gamma ray burst struck, an event so powerful it shattered the fabric of reality. The burst, unlike anything ever recorded, reduced the lush Earth to a stark, monochromatic realm known as the Pencil Earth Dimension—a flat, grayscale world where everything is drawn in sharp lines and shadows.</p>
            <p>In this new reality, Stickman awoke as a simple stick figure, stripped of the complexity he once knew. He wanders the Pencil Earth Dimension, haunted by memories of the lost world. The skies are now a dull gray, and the once-thriving ecosystems are reduced to sketches. Stickman’s journey is one of mourning, as he searches for meaning in a world that feels like a faded drawing of its former self. He often speaks of the "Second Earth," a term he uses for this altered reality, a pale imitation of the home he loved.</p>
            <p>Despite the despair, Stickman’s resilience shines through. He sketches new paths, hoping to rebuild or rediscover fragments of the original Earth, though the weight of loss lingers in every line of his being.</p>
            
            <h2 id="secret">The Secret of the Gamma Ray Burst</h2>
            <p><em>[Hidden Knowledge]</em> Unknown to Stickman, the catastrophic gamma ray burst was no accident. The mysterious figure known only as Unknown triggered the event, wielding an ancient power to reshape reality for reasons yet to be revealed. This secret drives a hidden tension in Stickman’s story, as he unknowingly crosses paths with the one responsible for his world’s destruction.</p>
            
            <h2 id="evolution">Evolution</h2>
            <p>Stickman’s form has evolved through the tragedy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Initial Design (v1.0)</strong>: A simple stick figure with no facial features, symbolizing universal potential on the original Earth.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Burst (v2.0)</strong>: Adapted to the Pencil Earth Dimension, gaining faint expressions of sorrow and determination.</li>
                <li><strong>Current Form (v3.0)</strong>: Subtle grayscale shading and minimal accessories, reflecting his struggle to find hope in a bleak world.</li>
            </ul>
